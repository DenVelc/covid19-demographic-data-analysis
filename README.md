#  COVID-19 & Demographic Data Analysis

This project provides an exploratory data analysis of COVID-19 case and vaccination data in conjunction with demographic indicators.

##  Project Structure

- `Covid_19_Tracker.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing full analysis, visualizations, and dashboards.
- `Final Report_ COVID-19 & Demographic Data Analysis.pdf` – Final written summary of key findings, insights, and recommendations.
- `Covid 19 Data.csv` – Source dataset (not included here, assumed from Our World In Data).

##  Data Description

- **Source:** [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)
- **Records:** ~180,000 daily entries by country
- **Features:**
  - Epidemiological: total cases, deaths, tests, vaccinations
  - Demographic: population, life expectancy, GDP per capita, median age
  - Geographic: country names, latitude, longitude

##  Key Visualizations & Insights

1. **Cases per Capita (Map):** High case ratios in small countries; interactive by continent.
2. **Vaccination Coverage:** Top countries by absolute and per capita coverage.
3. **Time Series (Czechia vs. Slovakia):** Pandemic dynamics comparison.
4. **Population vs. Life Expectancy:** Scatter plot shows income-related trends.
5. **Top 10 Populous Countries:** Bar chart overview.

##  Conclusions

- Smaller countries often show higher per capita infection rates due to size and reporting.
- Visualizations enhance understanding of absolute and relative pandemic metrics.
- Future work could include forecasting and machine learning for pattern detection.

##  Recommendations

- Integrate correlation and regression analysis
- Apply clustering or predictive models
- Maintain clean, updated datasets for analysis
